# How to use AI models for textual data

Here, I uploaded some of my practices for working with texts. Note that I will gradually update this repository by adding new tutorials.

I hope this help new learners to learn about how to work with textual data through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Large Language Models (LLM).

Feel free to download the files and change them as you wish.
