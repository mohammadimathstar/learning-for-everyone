It's a practical, hands-on class where you'll learn from years of experience and real-world examples.When you join, you get lifetime access to the following:18 hours of live, interactive sessions. We'll use this time to discuss the first principles behind building machine learning systems.10 hours of step-by-step coding instructions. These practical sessions will show you how to build an end-to-end system from scratch.A final project where you'll build a complete solution and receive direct feedback on your work.100 coding assignments and practice questions.The entire source code of a working production system. It's yours. You can change and use it as you see fit.A private community where you'll collaborate with thousands of people from different backgrounds.Direct access to your instructor.Lifetime access to every past and future cohort.Program certificate upon completion.And the best part is\")"
