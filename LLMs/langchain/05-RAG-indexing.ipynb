    "\n",
    "As you know, LLMs are models that have been trained on large amount of data. While they can generate human-like contents, there is no gaurantee that their answers to be trustworthy. Let's consider that we would like to use LLMs to create a chatbot answering the questions of customers of a particular company. Since LLMs do not know anything about this company and its products (during training), they fail to provide appropritate answers to the customers. In order to address this issue, one may consider to fine-tune LLMs for this application. However, here we face two challenges: a) the need for large amount of data (from the company), b) the need for large computational resources (required for training LLMs). \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is a better solution that does not have these issues. One can help LLMs to provide appropriate answers (to the customers' questions) by providing contexts to the LLM. For instance, if a customer ask about a particular product, we can help the LLM by giving the model the information about this product. This is called `Retrieval Augmented Generation` (RAG) which means: \n",
    "* helping the LLM, by retrieving the relevant information from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical RAG consists of two component:\n",
    "* indexing: creation of a database containing the company data (in numerical format), \n",
    "* retrieval and generation: given a query (from a customer), retrieve the most relevant data (from the database) and generate the answer (based on the relevant data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we focus on the first component and the second one will be presented in the next tutorial."

The main reason is that not all text (of a document) is relevant to a particular question. Thus, by splitting the text into smaller chunks, we can retrieve only the relevant part.\n",

The applicant complained under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention \\nthat the investigation into his ill-treatment had been ineffective and that the \\nfirst-instance court had unjustifiably protracted the proceedings and had not \\ndelivered a verdict in the criminal case in which the applicant had had victim \\nstatus.\\n16.  The Court considers that the applicant’s complaints fall to be \\nexamined under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, \\nRadomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, § 126, \\n20 March 2018).\\n17.  The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill-founded',\n",

Lithuania (no. 960/13, §§ 40-41, 13 June 2017).\\n19.  The Court notes that in the present case, the criminal proceedings were \\nopened almost two years following the incident (see paragraphs 2 and 4 \\nabove); such a delay cannot be justified in the circumstances of the case. The \\npre-trial investigation lasted two years, which cannot in principle be said to \\nbe unreasonable. However, the first-instance court took two more years to \\nexamine the case, without a verdict being delivered after the deliberations. \\nIt is unclear how P. could have received a copy of the verdict on 30 September \\n2015, when the case file did not contain any verdict, either in hard copy or in',\n",
       "  'electronic format (see paragraphs 7 and 10 above), all the more so given that \\nthe applicant waited almost three more years until August 2018, when the \\npresident of the first-instance court sent him a copy of the verdict \\n(see paragraph 12 above). In this regards the Court observes that the note \\nsubmitted by the Government, allegedly confirming the receipt of the verdict \\nby P. on 30 September 2015 (see paragraph 7 above), does not contain any \\nreference to a case number or other specific feature of the criminal case in \\nquestion. It is thus not possible to identify in which exactly criminal case P. \\nhad received a copy of a verdict. Be that as it may, the delays in the opening \\nof the criminal case, the delays in the examination of the case and the delivery \\nof the verdict by the Babushkinskyi District Court in breach of procedural \\nrules (see paragraph 13 above) resulted in the expiry of the limitation period',\n",
       "  'ORLOV v. UKRAINE JUDGMENT\\n4\\nand the discontinuance of the prosecution (see paragraph 14 above). The \\nCourt reiterates that the purpose of providing effective protection against acts \\nof ill-treatment cannot be achieved where the criminal proceedings are \\ndiscontinued owing to the fact that the prosecution has become time-barred \\nwhere this has occurred as a result of flaws in the actions of the relevant State \\nauthorities (see, for instance, Dimitar Shopov v. Bulgaria, no. 17253/07, § 52, \\n16 April 2013).\\n20.  The Court finds that the failure of the police to open a criminal case \\nin a timely manner and the failure of the Babushkinskyi District Court to \\nexamine the case in accordance with the applicable procedural rules fell short \\nof the State’s positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention.\\n21.
